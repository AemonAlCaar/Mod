Mod: TAC-Tortuga:

Unit "Segelmeister":

- All of the unitmodel is from different Sid Meier's Pirates models.
- The animations are from Civilization Colonization - the "Imperial_Soldier"-model.
- Both have been improved and modified by "Schmiddie" from the TAC-Team with Blender, Nifskope and Gimp to create a new unit "Segelmeister" for TAC-Tortuga.
