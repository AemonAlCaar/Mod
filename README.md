 # Important instructions that only apply to develop2:

This branch uses Intel Threading Building blocks to achieve concurrent AI calculations in order to speed up the AI (inter)turn. 
The DLL built from this branch will only work if you copy tbb.dll and tbbmalloc.dll from "Project Files\tbb" to the directory where 
Colonization.exe resides. 

# Features (relative to Plains):

Ported and adapted Karadoc's pathfinder (originally written for the Civ4 mod K-Mod)  
Parallelized the job assigner subsystem and the K-mod pathfinder
Logging of AI actions (to enable ensure that LoggingEnabled = 1 is set in CivilizationIV.ini, the log itself is found in Logs\BBAI.log  
Most of the new terrain is now generated by FaireWeatherTweakEx.py  
Many AI improvements (including several critical issues that greatly impaired the AI)
