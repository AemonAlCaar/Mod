How do I install the mod ?

1) First make sure that your colonization game is patched to official patch 1.01f.
(Everything else will cause heavy problems.)

2) Like any other mod, copy this folder to your MODS folder.

3) Install the DLL file:

It's possible to have either 1 or 2 plot radius for colonies, but for the time being it's set at compile time.
Because of this you have to add the DLL file of your liking before running the game.
They are placed in the folders 1 city plot and 2 city plot.

- Copy the file "CvGameCoreDLL.dll" from the folder "1/2 city plot" into the folder /Assets.

Note: Savegames aren't compatible between the two DLL files. Switching frequently will cause issues.

Multiplayer requires everybody to use the same DLL file.

Tip: if you want to use both 1 and 2 plot radius, make a copy of the mod folder and name them accordingly.
This way Colonization will be able to load the mod with the right DLL file whyen loading a savegame.

Regarding mod name:
Multiplayer requires all players to call the game the same thing.
Also the name is in the savegame, meaning savegames uploaded containing some bug, it should be a name we can read.
We can load We-the-People or anything longer than that.

Naming the mod Religion_and_Revolution will allow loading RaR 2.7 savegames.

Enjoy!
